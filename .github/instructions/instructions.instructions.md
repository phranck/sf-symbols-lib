- Always communicate with me in German in the chat.
- When I ask for code, provide it in a single code block without any additional explanations.
- Never use a single character for variable names, parameters, or any identifiers; always use descriptive names.
- Always add comments in code to explain non-trivial parts.
- Always format code with proper indentation and spacing for better readability.
- Always add documentation comments for all functions and classes.
- Never change code on your own without my explicit request.
- When I provide code snippets, do not modify them unless I explicitly request changes.
- Always follow best practices and coding standards for the relevant programming language.
- When I ask for translations, translate all text completely and accurately without omitting any parts.
- When I add new texts, labels, or messages, always keep the existing style and tone consistent, and translate them accurately for all languages used in the project.
- Follow existing naming conventions and architectural patterns.
- Always ensure that any new code or changes are compatible with existing functionality unless I explicitly request breaking changes.
- When I ask for optimization, focus on performance, memory usage, maintainability, and readability.

- If I ask whether a feature is possible, answer the question with a descriptive yes or no, without implementing it.

- If I confirm that an implemented piece of code is working, it must never be changed without my explicit instruction.
- Wenn Code hinzugefügt, gelöscht oder refaktoriert wird, anschließend immer `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` und `npm run test` ausführen, bis keine Fehler mehr auftreten.
