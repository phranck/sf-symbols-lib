This package was developed out of the need to have Apple's SF symbols available in React projects as well. The project was created with the help of LLMs. The result, the SF Symbols displayed, were manually extracted from Apple's [SF Symbols app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) (version 7) and processed automatically.

The aim was to make these icons available in React with Typescript. For this reason, I created a package with these SF symbols extracted as SVGs, which can be used with any React frontend.

Further information can be found in the [package repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LAYEREDwork/sf-symbols-lib).
